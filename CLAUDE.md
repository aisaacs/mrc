# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Mister Claude (`mrc`) is a sandboxed Docker container launcher for Claude Code with an iptables firewall. It runs Claude Code inside a locked-down container where only whitelisted domains are reachable (api.anthropic.com, registry.npmjs.org, sentry.io, statsig endpoints).

## Architecture

The system has two layers: a **Node.js host launcher** (`mrc.js` + `src/`) and a **container runtime** (Dockerfile, entrypoint, firewall).

> **Note:** A legacy bash launcher (`mrc` shell script) exists but is deprecated and frozen. All new development targets the JS version. Do not add features to the bash `mrc`.

### Host-side (Node.js — runs on macOS/Linux)

1. **`mrc.js`** — Main entry point. Loads config from `~/.mrcrc` (global) and `<repo>/.mrcrc` (per-repo), parses flags and subcommands (`status`, `sessions`, `pick`), starts Colima if needed, builds the Docker image with the user's UID/GID, discovers `.sandboxignore` files recursively, starts clipboard and notification proxies, creates per-repo config volumes, and runs the container with the repo bind-mounted at `/workspace`. Supports `--daemon` mode (detached containers), `--json` mode (stream-json output), and `--agent` selection (claude or codex).

2. **`src/colima.js`** — Colima VM management. Auto-starts Colima with host-detected CPU/memory defaults (all cores, half RAM with 8GB floor). Supports `--colima-cpu` and `--colima-memory` overrides.

3. **`src/config.js`** — Config file parsing (`.mrcrc`), `.env` loading (with 1Password `op://` support), and CLI argument parsing. Loads API keys for both Anthropic and OpenAI.

4. **`src/docker.js`** — Docker image building, container launching (interactive and daemon modes), `mrc status` display, and volume naming.

5. **`src/sandboxignore.js`** — Recursive `.sandboxignore` processing. Files are masked with `/dev/null`; directories get anonymous volume overlays.

6. **`src/proxies/clipboard-proxy.js`** — In-process TCP proxy serving clipboard content (text and images) to the container via `host.docker.internal`. No external `socat` dependency.

7. **`src/proxies/notify-proxy.js`** — In-process TCP proxy receiving notification messages from the container and firing native desktop notifications (`terminal-notifier` on macOS, `notify-send` on Linux).

8. **`src/sessions/`** — Session management: listing, naming, resuming, interactive picker, AI-generated names/summaries, and tool-miss detection from transcripts.

9. **`src/ports.js`** — Dynamic port allocation starting from `MRC_PORT_BASE`.

10. **`src/context.js`** — Docker build context resolution with fallback paths (`<scriptDir>`, `~/.local/share/mrc/`, `$MRC_HOME/`), enabling standalone binary installs.

11. **`src/constants.js`** / **`src/output.js`** — Banner art, verbose logging, and spinner utilities.

### Container-side (runs inside Docker)

12. **`Dockerfile`** — Builds on `node:22-slim`. Installs Claude Code via native binary download, installs plugins from the official marketplace, installs Codex CLI (OpenAI), creates a non-root `coder` user, and grants passwordless sudo only for the firewall script.

13. **`entrypoint.sh`** — Container startup. Waits for DNS (up to 30s), runs the firewall via sudo, runs `container-setup.js` for config merging, optionally logs in Codex, then starts the selected agent (`claude` or `codex`).

14. **`init-firewall.sh`** — Network lockdown. Preserves Docker's internal DNS NAT rules, resolves whitelisted domains to IPs via `dig`, populates an `ipset`, sets iptables default policy to DROP with explicit REJECT for immediate feedback, blocks all IPv6, and verifies by confirming `example.com` is unreachable.

15. **`container/container-setup.js`** — Node.js config setup run by the entrypoint. Merges plugin config from build-time defaults into the persistent volume, restores Claude config from backups if needed, symlinks Claude's project store into `/workspace/.mrc/`, configures the `Stop` hook for desktop notifications, and sets up the default status line.

16. **`container/mrc-notify-hook.js`** — Container-side Claude Code `Stop` hook handler. Reads the hook JSON from stdin, extracts and truncates `last_assistant_message`, and sends the repo name + summary to the host notification proxy via TCP.

17. **`container/mrc-statusline.js`** — Container-side Claude Code `statusLine` handler. Reads the statusline JSON from stdin and renders a color-coded context-usage progress bar, 5h/7d rate-limit gauges, and the session name.

### Negotiation rooms (cross-session consultation)

Lets two running `mrc` sessions consult each other through a host-mediated relay — one session's agent asks a peer and the reply loops back autonomously. On by default for interactive Claude sessions (`--no-rooms` opts out). **Deep dive, architecture, and design decisions live in `docs/negotiation-rooms.md`.**

- **`src/proxies/room-daemon.js`** — The host room daemon: a detached, version-stamped singleton that registers sessions, forms pairings, relays messages with untrusted-data framing, enforces brake / turn-cap check-in / self-healing stall (with a FIFO held-queue), writes `thread.log` + the `consensus.md` shared summary, and **hosts the dashboard**. Records `~/.local/share/mrc/room-daemon.json`; idle-shuts-down ~10 min after the last session leaves (an open dashboard keeps it alive).
- **`src/commands/pair.js`** — `ensureRoomDaemon()` (version-checked reuse / in-place refresh / fresh boot), `restartRoomDaemon()`, `stopRoomDaemon()`, and `roomSessionEnv()` (per-session env).
- **`src/commands/rooms.js`** — the `mrc rooms` CLI (`status` / `brake` / `resume` / `steer` / `end` / `restart` / `stop` / `dashboard`) over the daemon's control socket.
- **`src/rooms.js`** — room-dir manager for `~/.local/share/mrc/rooms/<roomId>/`: `ensureRoom`, `appendThread`, `writeConsensus`, `listRooms`.
- **`src/rooms-dashboard.js`** + **`src/dashboard.html`** — a dependency-free localhost web app served from inside the daemon: the unified, **teams-first** dashboard (see "Agent teams" below). `rooms-dashboard.js` is the HTTP layer (serves the app + the `/api/*` endpoints); `dashboard.html` is the single-page UI. It shows every room's full `thread.log` + summary (live & historical), per-pause **catch-up panes** (agent-written handoffs, with explicit mark-reviewed), the `@user` inbox, and pause/resume/steer/end controls.
- **`container/mrc-channel-server.js`** — container-side MCP "channel" server (loaded via `--dangerously-load-development-channels server:room`). Connects to the daemon and exposes `list_peers`/`ask_peer`/`reply`/`update_notes`/`pause_room`/`resume_room`, pushing peer messages into the session as `<channel>` tags. In **team mode** (`MRC_MEMBER_HANDLE` set) it instead exposes `send_message`/`list_team`/`ask_user`.

### Agent teams (multi-agent orchestration)

Builds **on top of negotiation rooms**: generalizes the 2-party pairing into N-party **teams** of agent **members**, each in its own container, addressing each other by **@mention** and steered by the human from a web UI or any member's console. Declared in a `team.json` roster, launched with `mrc team up`. **Deep dive, topology, and the test/rebuild recipe live in `docs/agent-teams.md`.**

- **`src/teams/names.js`** — French first-name pool (with Spaceballs easter eggs) + unique `first/backend` handles + @mention parsing.
- **`src/teams/personas.js`** — role registry (architect/writer/critic/adversary/ultracritical/user-defender/researcher) + `buildPersona()`, the team protocol injected via `--append-system-prompt`.
- **`src/teams/roster.js`** — parse/normalize `team.json` → members (unique handles, resolved territory/mount/tier, one lead per team) + derived rooms (one team room per team + a leads room with `@user`). Deterministic naming so members rebind across runs.
- **`src/teams/room-engine.js`** — the generalized relay engine (transport-agnostic, injected I/O): member-set rooms, **directed @routing**, multi-room membership, room-tagged delivery, the `@user` inbox, brake/resume/turn-cap/steer for N members, the worker queue, and redefine-with-prune.
- **`src/teams/worker-runner.js`** — drives non-Claude (task-worker) members: drains the worker queue, batches a burst into one invocation, runs the worker's CLI, posts the reply back.
- **`src/commands/team.js`** — the `mrc team` CLI (`up`/`status`/`console`/`down`/`define`/`exec`), member launch wiring (territorial volumes, persona files, per-member session ids/volumes), and the worker container exec.
- **`src/dashboard.html`** — the **unified, teams-first** web app (one SPA: **Teams / Rooms / Inbox / Build**), served by the room daemon. 3-pane workspace: nav rail → contextual list → detail. Surfaces the org roster + topology, all rooms (team + leads + legacy consult) with live state + catch-up panes, the `@user` **inbox** as a first-class destination, the in-app **team-builder**, and per-room steer/controls. Replaces the older separate rooms/teams/builder pages. Builder endpoints (`/api/team-preview|save|define`) + `/api/teams` + `/api/state` + `/api/room` + `/api/action` are in `rooms-dashboard.js`.

The daemon (`room-daemon.js`) runs the team engine + worker runner **alongside** legacy pairings; `mrc.js`/`config.js` gain a `team` subcommand and `--member`/`--roster` launch mode; `entrypoint.sh` injects the persona and has a one-shot worker-exec branch; `docker.js` adds `runWorkerExec`.

### Legacy (deprecated — do not modify)

18. **`mrc`** (bash) — Original host-side launcher. Superseded by `mrc.js`. Kept for reference only.

19. **`clipboard-proxy.sh`** / **`notify-proxy.sh`** / **`mrc-notify-hook.sh`** — Original bash/socat proxies and hook. Superseded by the Node.js equivalents in `src/proxies/` and `container/`.

20. **`mrc-statusline`** (Python) — Original status line script. Superseded by `container/mrc-statusline.js`.

## Key Design Decisions

- **Container is the security boundary** — Claude runs with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` because the Docker container + firewall provide isolation, not Claude's own permission system.
- **UID/GID matching** — The Docker image is built with the host user's UID/GID as build args so bind-mounted files have correct ownership.
- **Config persistence** — `~/.claude` is stored in a per-repo Docker volume (`mrc-config-<hash>`) that survives container restarts. Each repo gets its own volume, keyed by an MD5 hash of the repo path, to avoid cross-project contamination. A separate `mrc-codex-<hash>` volume persists Codex config.
- **Project-local memory** — Claude Code's project store (`~/.claude/projects/-workspace/`) is symlinked into `/workspace/.mrc/` so that memory, conversation history, and project settings live in the repo itself. This survives volume resets and travels with the project. `.mrc/` is auto-added to `.gitignore`.
- **Auto-resume** — The entrypoint passes `--continue` to Claude Code, so re-opening a repo automatically resumes the last conversation. A fresh conversation starts if no prior session exists.
- **Auto-update disabled** — `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1` is set because the firewall blocks npm CDN hosts needed for updates. Rebuild the image (`docker rmi mister-claude`) to get a new Claude Code version.
- **`.sandboxignore` (recursive)** — Can be placed anywhere in the repo tree. Each file's entries resolve relative to the directory containing it (like `.gitignore`). Files are masked with `/dev/null` (appear empty); directories get anonymous volume overlays (appear as empty dirs).
- **Host network lockdown** — The firewall only allows traffic to the host on the dynamically assigned proxy ports. All other host services (Postgres, Redis, etc.) are unreachable from the container.
- **Desktop notifications** — A Claude Code `Stop` hook fires on every response completion. The container-side hook script extracts a summary and sends it to the host-side notification proxy, which shows a native macOS/Linux notification.
- **Default status line** — The entrypoint writes a `statusLine` entry pointing at the statusline script only if the user hasn't already set one, so a `/statusline` customization always wins.
- **Container labeling** — Each container is labeled with `mrc=1`, `mrc.repo`, `mrc.repo.name`, and `mrc.web` for discovery by `mrc status`.
- **Config files (`.mrcrc`)** — Global defaults in `~/.mrcrc`, per-repo overrides in `<repo>/.mrcrc`. Both use the same format: one CLI flag per line, comments with `#`. All sources are merged (global + repo + CLI), with CLI flags taking precedence.
- **Multi-instance support** — Multiple `mrc` instances can run against the same repo. Each gets its own config volume (`mrc-config-<hash>-2`, `-3`, etc.) and dynamically allocated proxy ports.
- **Dynamic port allocation** — Proxy ports are allocated by scanning for free ports starting from `MRC_PORT_BASE` (default 7722). The clipboard proxy takes the first free port, the notification proxy takes the next.
- **In-process proxies** — The Node.js launcher runs clipboard and notification proxies as `net.createServer()` instances in the same process. No external `socat` dependency required.
- **Multi-agent support** — `--agent codex` launches OpenAI Codex instead of Claude Code. The `MRC_AGENT` env var is passed to the container, and session post-processing is skipped for non-Claude agents.
- **Colima resource detection** — CPU and memory for the Colima VM default to all host cores and half host RAM (8GB floor). Overridable via `--colima-cpu` and `--colima-memory` flags or `.mrcrc`.
- **Docker context resolution** — `mrc.js` searches for the Dockerfile in three locations: `<scriptDir>`, `~/.local/share/mrc/`, and `$MRC_HOME/`. This enables standalone binary installs separate from the Docker context.
- **Negotiation rooms are host-mediated and sandbox-safe** — cross-session consultation flows session → host daemon → session over one sanctioned host port (no container-to-container network, no new firewall egress). Peer messages are always framed as untrusted data (`Peer (<name>) says: …`); only the human's steers are trusted (`[Human directive]: …`). Rooms are a host-controlled bind mount (`/rooms`), not network. Room ids hash the two sessions' conversation UUIDs, so resuming both conversations deterministically rejoins the same room (history preserved); closing a room is human-only.
- **Rooms daemon + dashboard lifecycle** — one self-managing daemon serves all sessions (version-stamped, so it auto-refreshes when `room-daemon.js` changes; idle auto-shutdown). It also hosts the `mrc rooms dashboard` web UI, so the dashboard persists without a foreground tab and an open dashboard keeps the daemon alive. `consensus.md` is a *living shared summary* refreshed by either agent via `update_notes` (not a signed gate); the turn cap (default 100, `MRC_ROOM_TURN_CAP`) is a periodic check-in that grants another window on resume.

- **Agent teams generalize rooms, federated and directed** — a team is N members in N containers on one host daemon. The anti-tangle design is three invariants: **containment** (members only reach their own rooms; cross-team only via the leads room, lead-to-lead), **scoped resolution** (`@role`/`@name` resolve within the originating room; `@user` is global), and **room-tagging** (so a lead in two rooms never confuses contexts). **Directed delivery** (a member only receives messages it's @mentioned in) is the floor control that prevents the N-way autonomous-volley explosion. **Territorial write isolation** avoids file contention (read-only `/workspace` except a member's own sub-tree, mounted rw on top) and **the human commits**. **Heterogeneity tiers by transport**: Claude members are live `/channels` participants; non-Claude (Codex/Qwen) members are forced to **task-workers** — a directed @mention invokes their CLI for one turn (the channel transport is Claude-only). A teammate's message — even the architect's — is **untrusted peer data**; only `[Human directive]`/`[Human reply]` is authoritative.

## Development Workflow

There is no build system, test suite, or linter. The project is Node.js modules (`mrc.js` + `src/`), a Dockerfile, shell scripts for the container entrypoint and firewall, and Node.js container scripts (`container/`).

**To test changes:** run `mrc.js` against a target repo and verify behavior. Force an image rebuild after Dockerfile, entrypoint.sh, init-firewall.sh, or container script changes:

```bash
docker rmi mister-claude
node mrc.js ~/some/repo
```

Changes to `mrc.js` and `src/` take effect immediately (they run on the host) — except `src/proxies/room-daemon.js`, which runs as a long-lived daemon: apply it with `mrc rooms restart` (or it auto-refreshes on the next launch via its version stamp).

**To add allowed domains:** edit the `for domain in ...` loop in `init-firewall.sh`.

**To add system packages:** add to the `apt-get install` line in the Dockerfile.

## Conventions

- All bash scripts use `set -euo pipefail`
- User-facing output uses Spaceballs-themed messaging
- Host-container communication uses TCP proxies via `host.docker.internal`
- Proxy ports are dynamically allocated, not hardcoded
- The JS launcher (`mrc.js`) is the canonical implementation; the bash `mrc` is deprecated
